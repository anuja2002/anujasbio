  <h2>  Bio:</h2>
  <div>  My name is Anuja, I’m 17 and I’m from Northville, Michigan. I enjoy writing, skating, and I can now say coding. I’m going to be a senior in high school next year. I’m excited and nervous for college. I have a sister who lives in Atlanta, and I’d like a pupper and kitten who wear matching clothes when I’m older.</div>

  <p></p>

  <h3>Likes:</h3> Taco Bell, Olive Garden, Area 51 memes, Old Town Road Remixes, puppers, kittens, more puppers and kittens, dystopias, romances, mysteries, horrors, comedies, Brendon Urie, and Taco Bell!!!

  <p></p>

  <h3>Dislikes:</h3> PDA, people who stand in the middle of a hallway, ignorant people, overly happy people, people who pace and don’t sit down, people.

  <p></p>

  <h3>Fun Fact:</h3> I’ve been to like 12 countries and I’m too lazy to think of something other than the cliche pretentious “oh look at me I’ve been to __________ countries”
